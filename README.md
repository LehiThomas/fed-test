Front-end Developer Test
========

Clone this repo and build a page using the test1.jpg file as the deliverable you received from design. The test.html file contains all the text from the design comp so you do not need to re-type it. It also contains other information to help you on your way like fonts and colors.

## Requirements/instructions
* The page should be responsive. You may notice this doesn't include comps for sizes below desktop. How it looks is up to you.
* The FAQ section should expand and collapse when clicking on the question.
* Commit your changes frequently so we can see how your code progressed. We often will do this test in person with us watching the coding in real time. As a remote test, we would still like to get a sense of the progression of coding.
* We would like two versions of the site returned.  First is what you were able to accomplish within one hour. We do not expect it to be done in this amount of time. We are curious how far you got, and what you saw as the most important. Was it getting everything looking right, responsive aspects, functionality, etc.  There is no right answer as to what should be done first. The hour of coding is on your honor, but you are testing for a job at the Church after all, so we can trust you to be honest :) Make a commit at the hour mark with a commit message or tag saying this is the one hour version.
* The second version is the completed page that you would say is finished and ready to go out the door.
* Even the very best of us regularly go to the internet for help. Part of being a good front-end developer is having a good list of resources to go to when needed.  Where possible please document (in a comment within the code near the problem) where you didn't know how to do something and where you went to get an answer.
* Submit all your changes as a pull-request to the original repo.  The changes will not be accepted, but we will know you are done and where to go see it.
